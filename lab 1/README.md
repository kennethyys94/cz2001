What Is This?

This is a demo application for user to know more about how each particular method of Open Addressing Hashing algorithm works and also to find out each of the hashing method average CPU time and Key Comparison. 

How To Use The Application :

There are 2 Open Addressing Hashing Algorithms in the main menu for users to interact

1. Linear Probing - A Hash Table which a collision is resolved by putting the item in the next empty place in the array following the occupied slot.

2. Double Hashing - A Hash Table that makes the offsets to the next position probed depending on the key value, so that it will be different for every given key

Under their individual menu, following are the options for user to utilise

1. Search - Allows user to find and retrieve a particular value in the Hashtable.

2. Add - Allows user to insert a particular value into the Hashtable.

3. Delete - Allows user to retrieve a value that he/she searched for followed by the deletion of the value from the Hashtable.

4. Display Hashtable - Display the full list of Hashtable and also provide information whether it which slot is being occupied by a value.

5. Display Average CPU time - Display the average CPU time during runtime of the application.

6. Display Average Key Comparison - Display the average Key Comparison of the algorithm during runtime of the application.

7. Demo Load Factor - Let user input a load factor which the application will then use the load factor to compute and display the result back to the user.

8. Reset Average CPU time and Key Comparions - Reset both the average CPU time and Key Comparisons back to zero during the runtime of the application.

9. Back to main menu - Allows user to return back to the main menu
