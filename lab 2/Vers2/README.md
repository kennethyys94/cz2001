WHAT IS THIS?

This is a demo application to perform empirical comparison of time efficiency between two algorithm of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:

(((OneCaseApp)))
- User will input a size from 1000 to 1'000'000

THERE ARE 2 SORTING ALGORITHMS IN THE MAIN MENU FOR USERS TO INTERACT, INSERTION SORT AND MERGE SORT

0. Insertion Sort - An intuitive and primitive sorting method using incremental approach, given an unordered set of objects

1. Merge Sort - A Sorting Algorithm which uses Divide and Conquer approach that recursively divide a list into two halves of equal proportion and then merges two sorted sub-lists into one sorted list

UNDER EACH SORTING ALGORITHM, FOLLOWING ARE THE DATA TYPE FOR USER TO CHOOSE

1. Randomise - Randomly generated datasets of integers in the range [1 .. n]

2. Increment - Generating Integer of (1,2, … n) sorted in ascending order

// DISCLAIMER, for data type of descending order, due to the the number of key comparisons being large and the input size, the calculation of the CPU time will be slow depending on your current CPU speed
3. Decrement - Generating Integers of (n, n-1, .., 1) sorted in descending order
